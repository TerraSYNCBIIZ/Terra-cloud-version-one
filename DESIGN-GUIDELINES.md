- Persistent elements that maintain context
- Thoughtful micro-interactions that enhance understanding
- Visual continuity throughout user journeys

### 5. Accessibility and Inclusivity
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- Color schemes with sufficient contrast
- Interfaces usable with keyboard navigation
- Support for screen readers
- Responsive design that works across devices and screen sizes

## Visual Language
